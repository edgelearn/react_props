# ReactJS Props

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install â€”s prop-types
yarn start
```

## Using PropTypes

To use the prop-types module, it must be imported in the files it is to be used:

```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```

Make this change to the my-app/src/App.js file.

2. Set loggedIn prop to be false by default

## Passing/Receiving Unknown Props

1. Set the PropType to be PropTypes.node

2. Set the PropType to be PropTypes.any

3. Set the PropType to be PropTypes.oneOfType

## Handling Null Props

2. Return null in render() if data doesn't exist

## Passing Multiple Props
